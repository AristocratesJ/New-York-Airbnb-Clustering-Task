# New-York-Airbnb-Clustering-Task
This project is a part of Machine Learning course at Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science at Warsaw University of Technology.

## Dataset
We are going to use the dataset from Kaggle: [New York Airbnb](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vrindakallu/new-york-dataset). 
This dataset contains detailed information on rental listings in New York City. Some of the key features included are:
- 'latitude' and 'longitude': Geographic coordinates of the listings.
- 'room_type' : Type of rental (e.g., Entire home/apt, Private room, Shared room, Hotel room).
- 'price' : Price per night.
- 'ratings' : Guest ratings of the listings.
- 'bedrooms' : Number of bedrooms in the listing.
- 'baths' : Number of bathrooms.

## Project Goals
This project aims to perform clustering analysis on Airbnb data from New York City. By using machine learning techniques, we are going to identify groups of similar rental listings and analyze rental patterns in different New York City neighborhoods.

## Parts of the project
1. EDA (Exploatory Data Analysis) 
2. Feature engineering and first models
3. Final models and conclusions
